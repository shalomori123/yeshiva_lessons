# yeshiva_lessons
An helper script, to help the person in charge to upload the lessons of my Yeshiva, change file names and sort them over the directories of the database.

This intended to make the process more efficient and semi-automated.

The script upgraded over time, and got bigger with usage of classes, `Lesson` and `Editor`. The main file is "העלאת שיעורים.py" to help the understanding of non-programmers people.

Wanted Upgrades:
* Edit the metadata of the .mp3 file, to facilitate the parsing process of the info.
* Smarter indexing process in directories.
* Upload automatically to the Yeshiva site.
* Upload automatically to an drive backup.
* Upload automatically to Spotify.
